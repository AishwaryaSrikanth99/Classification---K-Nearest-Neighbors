# Classification---K-Nearest-Neighbors
Classification using KNN Algorithm with Python

The dataset used consists of artificial data. The last column denoted the "Target" and comprises of "0" or "1".

Our goal here is to classify data into "0" or "1" using KNN Algorithm.

The main challenge in KNN is to identify the appropriate "k" value where 'k' denotes the number of nearest neighbors to be taken into consideration. 
In this problem, we are using the "Elbow" method to find the apt k value which yields better classification accuracy.
